Testing Your ML Model with Sample Data
I've created a comprehensive script to help you test your pickled model file with new meal data. This will be useful for validating that your personalized glucose prediction models are working correctly.
What the Script Does
The test_model.py script allows you to:

Load any model file - Either a standard model or a user-specific model
Generate sample meal data - Creates realistic food combinations with nutrients and GI values
Use custom meal data - Load your own meal data from a JSON file
Test predictions - See predicted glucose responses for each meal
Generate time series data - If your model supports it, view glucose predictions over time
Save test results - Export all predictions to a JSON file for analysis

How to Use the Script
The example commands I've provided show different ways to use the script:

Basic testing with sample data:

Generates 5 random test meals
Tests them against the standard model
Saves results to prediction_results.json


Testing with user-specific model:

Uses a user's personalized model
Generates sample meals for testing
Shows how the personalized model performs


Using custom data:

Allows you to test with your own meal data and user profiles
Useful for testing specific meal scenarios



Sample User Profile
I've also included a sample user profile JSON that shows the format expected by the script. This includes demographic information, health metrics, and other data used by your personalization algorithms.
Script Features
The script includes several important components:

Feature Preparation Logic - Matches the implementation in your models.py file
Time Series Generation - Tests the model's ability to predict glucose over time
Model Information Display - Shows training metrics and other model details
Comprehensive Error Handling - Gracefully handles various error conditions

Running the Tests
To test your model:

Save the script as test_model.py in your project root
Run one of the example commands
Check the output in your terminal for prediction summaries
Review the detailed JSON results file for complete information
